# 19-React-Memory-Game
<br>
Memory game that listens to user click events and dynamically renders content based on user choices

# The Theme & Rules
<br>
This Memory match game is based on the show Stranger Things on Netflix. When the user first clicks on a character image the images will shuffle and the score will increase by one. If the user clicks on the same image twice the game resets itself.

# Technologies Used
<br>
The main purpose of this game is to train in the use of components by react. There is no back-end part of the application. I used Bootstrap as a the CSS framework. The app was deployed using Heroku.
